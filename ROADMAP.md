# Quickshell Roadmap

Features to implement. Each entry becomes its own Quickshell component or launcher plugin.

**UX principles:**

- Overlays are reachable from multiple entry points: bar widgets open their
  corresponding overlay on click, and all overlays are searchable and
  openable from the launcher.
- Overlays are modal, following vim bindings as closely as the UI context allows.
- Everything controllable via keyboard must also be controllable via IPC, so
  overlays can be driven programmatically (automation, agentic development).
- Keyboard-first. Mouse support is a future concern.

## Configuration / Portability

Hardcoded assumptions that should be user-configurable.

- [1] ✅ **Configurable terminal** — `programs.kh-ui.launcher.terminal` option (defaults to `pkgs.kitty`); injected as `bin.terminal` into the launcher's `NixBins.qml` via `extraBins`; `kh-launcher.qml` uses `bin.terminal` instead of `bin.kitty`
- [2] ✅ **`kitty` removed from universal `ffi.nix` bins** — moved to launcher-specific `extraBins` as `terminal`; no longer injected into bar, cliphist, or view configs
- [3] ✅ **Compositor-agnostic autostart** — `hm-module.nix` registers each enabled component as a `systemd.user.services` unit bound to `graphical-session.target`; works on any compositor with systemd-user integration, adds `Restart=on-failure` for crash recovery, and benefits from Home Manager's `sd-switch` strategy (services auto-restart when the store path changes on rebuild)

---

## Clipboard History

Standalone Quickshell daemon (`quickshell -c kh-cliphist`) with a searchable
list of clipboard entries from `cliphist`. SUPER+V toggles it via IPC.

### Core

- [1] ✅ Searchable list — all text entries pre-decoded on open so search matches full content
- [2] ✅ Text entries shown as-is; image entries shown as thumbnails
- [3] ✅ Enter copies the selected entry via `cliphist decode | wl-copy`; entry flashes on copy
- [4] ✅ Search filters — `img:` / `text:` type filter, `'` exact substring match
- [5] ✅ Entry counter in footer
- [6] ✅ Fast search — haystacks pre-processed at load time; filter debounced at 80 ms; full-text cache updated via O(1) index lookup as decode streams in
- [7] ✅ IPC — `toggle`, `setMode`, `nav`, `key`, `type`

### Navigation

- [1] ✅ Modal insert/normal mode — opens in normal mode; `j`/`k` navigate, `G` bottom, `/` → insert (search focused); Escape → normal mode or closes
- [2] ✅ `gg` top, `G` bottom, `Ctrl+D`/`Ctrl+U` half-page scroll
- [3] ✅ Emacs bindings in insert mode — `Ctrl+A`/`E` start/end, `Ctrl+F`/`B` forward/back char, `Ctrl+D` delete forward, `Ctrl+K` delete to end, `Ctrl+W` delete word, `Ctrl+U` delete to line start

### Detail Panel

- [1] ✅ Detail panel layout — always-visible side pane (40/60 split); auto-loads selected entry on navigation (120 ms debounce)
- [2] ✅ Detail panel text metadata — char/word/line count shown for text entries
- [3] ✅ Detail panel image metadata — dimensions and file size shown for image entries
- [4] ✅ Detail panel navigation — `Tab`/`l` enters the panel; `Tab`/`Esc` returns to the list
- [5] ✅ Detail panel cursor and motions — `hjkl`/`w`/`b`/`e`/`W`/`B`/`E`; `0`/`$`/`^` line
- [6] ✅ Detail panel visual select — `v`/`V`/`Ctrl+V` char/line/block; word motions extend char selection; `o`/`O` swap anchor corner; `y` copies selection
- [7] ⬜ Insert mode in detail panel — edit text content inline before copying; vim operator bindings (`ciw`, `dw`, etc.); `i`/`a`/`I`/`A`/`o`/`O` to enter insert; Escape back to normal; `y` copies the modified content

### Fullscreen View

- [1] ✅ Fullscreen view — `Enter` from detail opens; `Escape` returns; full text/image filling the panel
- [2] ✅ Fullscreen navigation — `hjkl`/`w`/`b`/`e`/`W`/`B`/`E` cursor; `0`/`$`/`^` line; `gg`/`G`/`Ctrl+D`/`U` navigate
- [3] ✅ Fullscreen visual select — `v`/`V`/`Ctrl+V` char/line/block; word motions extend; `o`/`O` swap anchor corner; `y` copies selection
- [4] ⬜ Insert mode in fullscreen — same as detail panel insert mode, for the fullscreen view

### Help

- [1] ✅ Help overlay — `?` opens a popup showing all mode bindings (normal / visual / insert) at once; `/` filters rows inline; popup shrinks to fit matches
- [2] ⬜ Context-aware help — visually highlight the section corresponding to the current mode; all sections remain visible but the active one is called out

### Entry Management

- [1] ✅ Delete single entry — `d` in normal mode; confirmation popup; executes via `cliphist delete`; cursor repositions to the entry above
- [2] ✅ Delete range in visual mode — `d` deletes all entries in the selected range; confirmation popup before executing
- [3] ✅ Delete animation — fade-out on deleted entries
- [4] ✅ Pin toggle — `p` toggles pin on the selected entry
- [5] ✅ Pinned entries sort to top — pinned entries appear at the top of both unfiltered and search-filtered lists
- [6] ✅ Pin persistence — persisted to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/kh-cliphist/pins` (one entry ID per line); deleting a pinned entry removes it from the pin set
- [7] ✅ Pin visual indicator — 3 px coloured bar on the left edge of each pinned delegate row
- [8] ⬜ Batch pin in visual mode — `p` in visual mode toggles pin on all entries in the selected range

### Metadata

- [1] ✅ Timestamp on entries — first-seen time shown right-aligned on each row ("just now" / "5m ago" / "3h ago" / "2d ago" / "4w ago"); persisted to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/kh-cliphist/meta/timestamps`; stale IDs pruned on each load; refreshes on reopen
- [2] ⬜ Source app attribution — record the active Hyprland window at copy time and show it on each row. Attempted via `wl-paste --watch` + `hyprctl activewindow`, but accuracy is poor: (1) copying from within the cliphist overlay always reports the last regular window; (2) every copy-from-overlay creates a mis-attributed entry. Needs a Hyprland plugin/event hook or a Wayland protocol that exposes the source client of a clipboard change.

### Integration

- [1] ⬜ Auto-paste — close the window and simulate Ctrl+V into the previously focused app via `wtype`

---

## Launcher

Extensible modal launcher (`quickshell -c kh-launcher`). Each **launcher plugin**
registers a named item source (apps, open windows, emoji, …); `]` / `[` cycles
between them, Enter picks an item. The built-in **Apps** plugin has no
special-casing — it is registered alongside user-defined plugins through the
same contract.

### Core

Plugin-agnostic infrastructure shared by every plugin.

- [1] ✅ Fuzzy search over item `label + description`
- [2] ✅ Search filters: `'` exact match, `^` prefix, `$` suffix, `!` negation; space-separated tokens combine with AND
- [3] ✅ Description shown in list (one line below the label)
- [4] ✅ `j`/`k` navigate, `Enter` confirm; opens in insert mode (search field focused)
- [5] ✅ Window closes automatically after a selection
- [6] ✅ Flash animation (green) on selection
- [7] ✅ `?` toggles a searchable help overlay listing all keybinds; help sections are state-aware (actions vs. normal/insert)
- [8] ✅ Per-item icons — display the icon image (not just the label) in the list row
- [9] ✅ Plugin switching — `]` / `[` cycle plugins; click a plugin chip to jump directly; `activatePlugin` / `nextPlugin` / `prevPlugin` / `returnToDefault` via IPC
- [10] ✅ Script plugins — any external process can push items (label, description, icon, callback, optional id) into a named plugin via TSV stdout or IPC and receive the user's selection back; makes the launcher infinitely extensible without baking in every plugin; Nix option `programs.kh-ui.launcher.scriptPlugins` registers named plugins that appear alongside built-in ones, and runtime IPC (`registerPlugin` / `addItem` / `itemsReady`) supports ad-hoc push-based plugins
- [11] ⬜ Combi plugin *(depends on 10)* — a named plugin that concatenates results from multiple sources (e.g. apps + open windows + system commands) into one unified search, rofi-`combi`-style; each source is tagged so rows show their origin (`[app]` / `[window]` / …) and can carry a per-source ranking bias; different Enter semantics per source (launch vs. focus vs. execute) routed by the source tag; opt-in — default plugins stay single-source to keep rankings and Enter behaviour coherent
- [12] ⬜ Plugin-owned Enter semantics — `Ctrl+1–9` workspace-launch is currently wired directly into the common launch path, which only makes sense when the callback is a process-spawn command; it is nonsensical for plugins whose Enter means "focus" (window switcher), "copy to clipboard" (emoji), "execute" (system commands), etc. Move modifier-Enter handling into plugin-provided callbacks so each plugin defines its own semantics, and the apps plugin keeps `Ctrl+1–9 → hyprctl dispatch exec [workspace N] <command>` as a plugin-local behaviour
- [13] ⬜ Plugin-owned ranking / frecency — the decayed-launch counter (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/kh-launcher/meta/frecency`, `3·log2(1+count)` boost, 14-day half-life) is currently the only ranking signal available and, in practice, only the apps plugin opts in. Other plugins want different semantics: window switcher should rank by recent-focus order sourced from Hyprland, system commands barely need ranking, snippets probably want alphabetical. Expose ranking as a plugin-provided hook (or a named strategy) rather than a single shared counter, so each plugin chooses its own scoring and tie-breaker
- [14] ✅ Plugin label distinct from IPC key — every plugin has a stable attribute-name *key* (what IPC targets: `activatePlugin`, `removePlugin`, `listPlugins` output) and a human-facing `label` that drives the chip text. Label defaults to the key when empty, so existing plugins need no change. Set it via the `label` field on Nix-registered plugins (built-in `apps.nix`, `hyprland-windows.nix`, or entries under `programs.kh-ui.launcher.scriptPlugins.<name>.label`) or as the 6th positional argument to `registerPlugin` at runtime. Motivating use case: a compositor-qualified key like `hyprland-windows` can present itself on the chip as simply `Windows`, leaving room for peer plugins (`sway-windows`, …) without an identifier collision. Docs: `docs/launcher-plugins.md` concept table + IPC reference

### Plugins

#### Apps *(default, built-in)*

Fuzzy search over installed `.desktop` applications; Enter launches.

- [1] ✅ Haystack is `name + comment` from each `.desktop` entry
- [2] ✅ App icons in the list row — XDG icon resolution with SVG / PNG fallback via the scan script; fallback glyph is the label's first letter
- [3] ✅ Apps with `Terminal=true` run wrapped in the configured terminal (`bin.terminal`)
- [4] ✅ Ctrl+1–9 launches the selected app on workspace 1–9 via `hyprctl dispatch exec [workspace N] <command>` *(currently wired into Core's launch path — see Core [12])*
- [5] ✅ Frecency ranking — per-app decayed launch counter persisted at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/kh-launcher/meta/frecency` (via shared `MetaStore`); fuzzy score gets a `3·log2(1+count)` boost so frequently-launched apps surface higher without swamping strong prefix matches; each count decays with a 14-day half-life; empty query sorts by decayed count then name *(currently the only ranking hook any plugin can use — see Core [13])*
- [6] ✅ `l` / Tab enters actions state for the selected app (only switches if the app has desktop actions)
- [7] ✅ `j`/`k` navigate actions; `Enter` launches the selected action; `h` / Esc returns to the app list
- [8] ✅ Action rows show the parent app's icon next to each desktop action

#### Window switcher

Plugins in this section are compositor-specific — each compositor needs its own
data source and focus dispatch, so they ship as separate plugins rather than
one abstracted "window switcher".

- [1] ✅ **Hyprland window switcher** — Hyprland-only. IPC key `hyprland-windows`, chip label `Windows` (via the new plugin-`label` concept — stable key stays compositor-qualified for future peers, but the UI stays terse). Fuzzy search over all open windows by app name or title, across all workspaces and monitors; Enter runs `hyprctl dispatch focuswindow address:<addr>` which focuses the window and switches to its workspace; windows are listed most-recently-focused first (Hyprland `focusHistoryID`); icons resolved from each window's WM class via `StartupWMClass` in `.desktop` files with a fallback to the class name and then `application-x-executable`; exits cleanly with no items outside a Hyprland session

#### Emoji picker

- [1] ⬜ Fuzzy search emoji by name; Enter copies to clipboard

#### Snippets

- [1] ⬜ Text expansion triggered by abbreviation

#### System commands

- [1] ⬜ Lock, sleep, reboot, etc. as searchable actions

#### Color picker *(long term)*

- [1] ⬜ Screen dropper; Enter copies hex/rgb to clipboard

#### File search *(long term)*

- [1] ⬜ `fd`/`fzf` over `$HOME`; Enter opens in default app

---

## Bar

A full status bar built in Quickshell, replacing Waybar.

### Core

- [1] ✅ Plugin authoring system — plugins are `.qml` files wired in via Nix (`structure`/`extraPluginDirs`); built at eval time so no runtime module import is needed
- [2] ✅ Per-plugin IPC targets — each plugin sets `ipcName: "<segment>"` and writes `IpcHandler { target: ipcPrefix }`; `BarPlugin` scopes `ipcPrefix = parentPrefix + "." + ipcName` so the target resolves via QML lexical scope (e.g. `bar.volume`, `bar.workspaces`)
- [3] ✅ Dropdown IPC — dropdowns with `ipcName` set expose `bar.<name>` with `toggle`/`open`/`close`/`isOpen`
- [4] ✅ `BarGroup` plugin — a container plugin that groups any number of child plugins behind a single dropdown button; children are declared inline in `structure` exactly like top-level plugins; any plugin (Volume, Workspaces, custom) can appear inside a group or directly in the bar — placement is independent of plugin type; the button shows a configurable label or icon; implement before hierarchical IPC
- [5] ✅ Hierarchical IPC prefix — `ipcPrefix` propagates through `BarPlugin` → `BarRow` → `BarDropdown.col` via parent chain walk; `BarPlugin`, `BarGroup`, `BarDropdown`, and `BarTooltip` each append their own `ipcName` segment via the shared `parentPrefix + "." + ipcName` pattern so nested targets like `bar.controlcenter.tailscale` or `bar.sonarr.error` fall out automatically; root prefix is `ipcName` from `mkBarConfig` (default `"bar"`), exposed as `programs.kh-ui.bar.ipcName` in the hm-module; `EthernetPanel` and `TailscalePanel` converted from `BarControlTile` to `BarPlugin` base so they join the prefix chain regardless of popup nesting depth
- [6] ⬜ Plugin error surface — a standard mechanism for plugins to report failures to the user; currently any subprocess that exits non-zero is silently ignored and the plugin stays in its last known state; needs a shared primitive (e.g. a visual error state on `BarControlTile`, a toast, or a bar-level error badge) so plugins like `TailscalePanel` can surface "toggle failed" instead of doing nothing
- [7] ⬜ Multi-bar support — allow N bars at arbitrary screen edges (top, bottom, left, right); `mkBarConfig` accepts a list of `{ edge, structure }` entries; each bar gets its own `PanelWindow` and generated `BarLayout`; `BarDropdown` opens its popup toward the screen interior so it works on any edge; currently kh-bar uses a single `PanelWindow` with no screen binding (multi-screen removed pending this entry)
- [8] ✅ Root bar IPC — `ipcPrefix` itself (e.g. `bar`, `dev-bar`) exposes `getHeight()`/`getWidth()` returning the visible footprint in pixels, with `getHeight()` summing the bar's own height and the tallest currently-open dropdown popup so callers can size overlays or screenshot crops without hardcoded values; implemented inside the generated `BarLayout.qml` by walking children for visible popups
- [9] ✅ Service environment injection — `programs.kh-ui.bar.environment` (plaintext attrset) and `programs.kh-ui.bar.environmentFiles` (list of paths, typically sops/agenix) pass env vars to the `kh-bar` systemd service; plugins read via `Quickshell.env()`; follows the nixpkgs convention used by nginx/gitea/servarr so new plugins needing secrets require no special Nix scaffolding

### Building Blocks

Authoring primitives that make up a bar structure. Plugins compose these
rather than raw QtQuick types so layout, IPC prefix propagation, and theme
access stay consistent.

- [1] ✅ `BarPlugin` base type — every plugin extends it; `implicitWidth` sizes the plugin, `implicitHeight` tracks `barHeight`, `barWindow` is inherited from the parent chain, and `ipcPrefix` walks the parent chain (skipping plain `Row`/`RowLayout`) then appends the plugin's own `ipcName` segment so nesting in any container produces a correctly scoped IPC target
- [2] ✅ `BarRow` — full-width `RowLayout` row; carries `ipcPrefix` so children resolve IPC targets correctly
- [3] ✅ `BarSpacer` — flexible spacer filling remaining width; place between plugin clusters to push them apart (CSS space-between equivalent)
- [4] ✅ `BarPipe` — thin vertical separator; defaults to `base03`, 18 px tall, 6 px side margins; `pipeColor` / `pipeHeight` / margin props override per use
- [5] ✅ `BarGroup` — dropdown button wrapping arbitrary children as panel content; any plugin (Volume, Workspaces, custom) can live inside a group or at the top level with no plugin-side changes; see **Core [4]** for composition semantics and hierarchical IPC behaviour
- [6] ✅ `BarDropdown` — generic dropdown primitive used under the hood by `BarGroup`; exposes `toggle`/`open`/`close`/`isOpen` via IPC when `ipcName` is set (see **Core [3]**)
- [7] ✅ `BarText` — theme-styled text primitive exposing `normalColor` / `warnColor` / `errorColor` / `mutedColor` so threshold colouring doesn't need a `NixConfig { id: cfg }` at every call site
- [8] ✅ `BarIcon` — same contract as `BarText` but loads the bundled nerd-font via `FontLoader` so PUA codepoints (bell, tv, etc.) render deterministically regardless of the user's system fontconfig
- [9] ✅ `BarTooltip` — generic hover tooltip primitive; default content slot accepts any QML children (text, icons, rich content), opens on hover-after-delay (default 300 ms, matches the workspace-preview convention) and closes on mouse leave via `HoverHandler` on its parent. Positions below the bar (anchored to the parent's horizontal centre, clamped to screen edges) so the bar chrome isn't occluded. `active: false` disables without removing from the tree (bind it to `hasError` etc. so a tooltip exists but only triggers when there's something worth saying). Optional `ipcName` exposes `<ipcPrefix>.<ipcName>` with `pin` / `unpin` / `togglePin` / `isPinned` / `isVisible` — pin is an independent visibility input (`visible = (hoverShown OR pinned) AND active`) so keyboard/IPC workflows can show a tooltip without a physical hover. Driving use case: make plugin errors (`hasError` / `getError()` on SonarrPanel and eventual peers) readable at a glance instead of only through IPC; unblocks the visible half of **Core [6]** plugin error surface and is the mechanism that Sonarr [11] hooks into
- [10] ✅ `BarHorizontalDivider` — thin 1 px horizontal separator (formerly `DropdownDivider`, renamed and generalised). Spans the parent's width by default; theme-aware default colour (`_cfg.color.base02`), configurable via `dividerColor` and `dividerHeight`. Used between sections in `BarDropdown` panels (e.g. `TailscalePeers`) and between rows in `BarTooltip` content (e.g. Sonarr's multi-line error list)
- [11] ✅ `BarControlTile` — styled toggle-pill primitive for custom panel tiles (label, sublabel, active/pending states, theme colours); used by `TailscalePanel` and `EthernetPanel`. Formerly `ControlTile`, renamed for the `Bar*` prefix convention
- [12] ✅ `BarDropdownHeader` / `BarDropdownItem` — muted section heading + row-with-dot-and-two-labels primitives intended for `BarDropdown` panel content; formerly `DropdownHeader` / `DropdownItem`

### Workspaces

- [1] ✅ Workspace display — show Hyprland workspaces; highlight the active workspace
- [2] ✅ Workspace click to switch — click a workspace button to switch to it
- [3] ✅ Workspace preview on hover — hovering a button for 300 ms shows a thumbnail popup; disappears on mouse leave
- [4] ✅ Workspace preview thumbnails — composites per-window `ScreencopyView` captures at Hyprland IPC positions; scaled to 240 px wide
- [5] ✅ Workspace preview badge — workspace name badge in the corner of the thumbnail
- [6] ⬜ Workspace preview click-through — clicking a window inside the preview thumbnail focuses that specific window directly, not just the workspace
- [7] ⬜ Submap indicator — show the active Hyprland submap name (e.g. `resize`, `passthrough`) in the bar when a non-default submap is active; hidden during normal operation; sourced from the `submap` Hyprland IPC event
- [8] ⬜ Scratchpad indicator — show a count of hidden scratchpad windows; click cycles through them via `hyprctl dispatch togglespecialworkspace`; hidden when scratchpad is empty
- [9] ⬜ Per-delegate preview popup via `BarTooltip` *(depends on Building Blocks [9])* — today the Workspaces plugin uses a single shared `PopupWindow` whose content swaps based on `state.preview`/`state.btnX`, which enforces "only one preview visible at a time" as an implicit UX rule. Migrate to per-delegate popups by wrapping each delegate's content in `BarTooltip { ScreencopyView {...} }` so each workspace button owns its own independent popup; removes the shared `state.pending`/`state.preview`/`state.btnX` bookkeeping, lets multiple previews coexist (e.g. keyboard-pinned via the existing `showPreview(name)` IPC for side-by-side comparison), and deduplicates the 300 ms hover-delay Timer that currently lives in `Workspaces.qml` against the same mechanic inside `BarTooltip`. ScreencopyView cost stays bounded — each per-delegate popup only captures while visible

### Active Window

- [1] ⬜ Active window title — display the focused window's app name and title

### Clock

- [1] ✅ Clock — live HH:mm display, updates every second
- [2] ⬜ Calendar dropdown — clock opens a dropdown on click; month grid with `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` navigation
- [3] ⬜ Stopwatch — start/stop/reset via click or IPC; elapsed time shown in the bar while running; hidden when stopped; supports multiple named concurrent stopwatches, each shown as a separate chip in the bar

### Audio

- [1] ✅ Volume scroll — scroll on the widget to adjust volume via PipeWire; hidden when no sink is available
- [2] ✅ Mute toggle — click the widget to toggle mute via PipeWire
- [3] ⬜ Microphone mute toggle — mutes the configured virtual PipeWire source node (not the physical device); the setup uses virtual sinks and sources that physical devices and apps route through, so mute targets the virtual node to silence all inputs simultaneously; configured via Nix with the target node name
- [4] ⬜ Output device quick switch — right-click or dropdown on the volume widget to select between available PipeWire sinks without opening the full Audio Mixer

### Media (MPRIS)

- [1] ✅ MPRIS playback controls — prev/play-pause/next buttons
- [2] ✅ MPRIS track display — artist and title shown alongside controls
- [3] ✅ MPRIS visibility — shows the first active player; hidden when no player is active
- [4] ⬜ MPRIS multi-source — when more than one player is active, show a dropdown (or similar) to select which source is displayed rather than always picking the first one
- [5] ⬜ Seek bar — progress indicator showing position within the current track; click or drag to seek; sourced from MPRIS `Position` and `Length` metadata
- [6] ⬜ Album art — thumbnail of the current track's artwork sourced from MPRIS `mpris:artUrl`; shown alongside artist/title
- [7] ⬜ Shuffle / repeat toggles — buttons reflecting and toggling the MPRIS `Shuffle` and `LoopStatus` properties

### System Tray

- [1] ✅ Taskbar icons — tray icons via StatusNotifierItem protocol; left click activates, right click shows native context menu via `display()`; hidden when no items present
- [2] ⬜ Overflow bucket — when icon count exceeds a configured limit, least-recently-interacted icons collapse into an expander chip; click expander to reveal the overflow tray

### Tailscale

- [1] ✅ Tailscale status polling — polls `tailscale status --json` every 10 s; parses `BackendState`, `TailscaleIPs`, and `Peer` map; exposes `connected`, `selfIp`, and `peers` for use in `TailscalePeers`
- [2] ✅ Tailscale tile appearance — `BarControlTile`-based pill; label + IP sublabel; highlights when connected via `activeColor`
- [3] ✅ Tailscale toggle on click — click the tile to run `tailscale up`/`down` and re-poll on exit; requires `tailscale` added to `extraBins` for the bar config so it is available as a Nix store path; also requires the user to be set as operator once: `sudo tailscale up --operator=$USER` (note: `tailscale set --operator` is [broken upstream](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/18294); `extraUpFlags` in the NixOS module only applies when `authKeyFile` is set)
- [4] ✅ IPC — `bar.tailscale` target exposes `isConnected()`, `getSelfIp()`, `toggle()`
- [5] ✅ Toggle pending state — while `tailscale up`/`down` is running, the tile pulses its opacity and shows `...` as the sublabel; double-clicks are ignored; opacity resets on completion
- [6] ⬜ Toggle error feedback — when `tailscale up`/`down` exits non-zero, surface the failure visibly on the tile (e.g. flash red, show a brief error sublabel, or emit a notification); currently the tile silently stays in its previous state; the most common cause is the operator not being configured (`sudo tailscale up --operator=$USER`)
- [7] ✅ Peer ping — click a peer row in `TailscalePeers` to run `tailscale ping -c 1 <ip>` and display the round-trip latency inline; secondary label shows `ping…` while in flight, then the latency (e.g. `24ms`) in `base0E`; clears back to IP after 5 s; double-click ignored while pending
- [8] ✅ Exit node selection — exit-node-capable peers shown in a separate section in `TailscalePeers`; click to run `tailscale set --exit-node <ip>`; active exit node highlighted in `base0A` with "active" sublabel; click again to clear; pending state blocks double-clicks and shows `…` on the active row
- [9] ⬜ Advertise exit node toggle — button to run `tailscale set --advertise-exit-node` on/off for the local machine
- [10] ⬜ Shields-up toggle — toggle `tailscale set --shields-up` to block incoming connections; reflected in the tile UI
- [11] ✅ Hover highlight in `TailscalePeers` — hovering a peer or exit node row shows a `base02` background rectangle; suppressed on exit node rows while a set/clear is pending

### Sonarr

Polls the Sonarr API and surfaces recently grabbed episodes in the bar.
Configured inline on `SonarrPanel` (host/port/pollInterval/apiKeyEnv/maxHistoryItems); API keys come from the systemd service `environment`/`environmentFiles` and are read via `Quickshell.env(apiKeyEnv)`. Multiple instances (e.g. separate TV + 4K servers) are supported by declaring multiple `SonarrPanel {}` children in the bar structure.

- [1] ✅ Queue badge — `SonarrPanel` polls `/api/v3/queue` at `pollInterval` (default 120 s) while visible; shows a TV glyph (`BarIcon`, mdi-television) plus the queue count; colour shifts to `base0B` when count > 0, `base08` on error, muted `base03` otherwise; pulses opacity while a request is in flight
- [2] ✅ Multi-instance support — declare multiple `SonarrPanel {}` in the bar structure with distinct `host`/`port`/`apiKeyEnv`; each instance has its own state, timer, Process, and IPC endpoint (via `ipcPrefix` chain); no registration or naming scheme in Nix
- [3] ✅ Secret via env var — `apiKeyEnv` property names the environment variable to read; the user wires it through `programs.kh-ui.bar.environment` (plaintext) or `environmentFiles` (sops/agenix); no plugin-specific Nix options
- [4] ✅ IPC — plugin exposes `<ipcPrefix>.sonarr` with `getNewCount()`, `getRecentGrabs()`, `getError()`
- [5] ⬜ Click-to-open panel — currently badge-only; wrap the badge in a `BarDropdown`/`BarGroup` (or add a click area) that opens a panel listing the recent grabs already held in `_state.recentGrabs` (series title, S/E, timestamp)
- [6] ⬜ Upcoming releases — poll `/api/v3/calendar` in addition to `/queue`; render upcoming episodes in the panel alongside recent grabs
- [7] ✅ Configuration validation — `functionality.validateConfig()` runs on `Component.onCompleted` and on any of `host`/`port`/`pollInterval`/`apiKeyEnv` changing; checks `host` non-empty, `port` in `1..65535`, `pollInterval` ≥ 5 s, `apiKeyEnv` non-empty, and the named env var resolves to a non-empty value via `Quickshell.env()`. Writes a specific message to `_state.configError` (e.g. `"SONARR_API_KEY env var is empty or unset"`, `"port 70000 out of range (1..65535)"`); the timer and `poll()` both gate on `configError === ""` so misconfigured instances never hit the API. `configError` is tracked separately from the runtime `error` so a config fix doesn't clobber a legitimate runtime error; on invalid→valid transition the validator kicks an immediate poll instead of waiting out a full interval. IPC exposes `getConfigError()`, and `getError()` returns `configError` first, falling back to `error`. Also fixes a pre-existing bug where `StandardPaths.getenv()` was used in place of the correct `Quickshell.env()` API
- [8] ⬜ Transport error detection — current error handling only catches parse failures and API error objects; curl failures (connection refused, DNS, timeout, TLS) silently set `_state.loading = false` in `onExited` without setting `_state.error`, so the badge keeps showing stale data. Switch to `curl -f` (fail on HTTP ≥ 400), check `exitCode` in `onExited`, and surface distinct messages for *network unreachable*, *401 unauthorised* (bad API key), *404* (wrong host/port), and *5xx* (Sonarr down)
- [9] ⬜ Per-instance error context — with multiple `SonarrPanel {}` instances, `_state.error` strings like `"Parse error"` or `"Empty response"` don't identify which server failed; prefix errors with the host or a user-provided `label` property so the tooltip/panel shows *which* instance is broken
- [10] ⬜ Retry with backoff — after a transport error, the plugin keeps polling at the full `pollInterval`, delaying recovery when the server comes back but also hammering it during outages; use exponential backoff (e.g. 10 s → 60 s → 300 s cap) while `_state.error` is set, reset on the first success
- [11] ✅ Visible error surface via `BarTooltip` — hovering the badge (or `qs ipc call <ipcPrefix>.sonarr.error pin` for IPC-driven pin) shows every failed config check, each on its own line separated by a `BarHorizontalDivider`. `active: root.hasError` gates the tooltip so it only triggers when there's something to say; `ipcName: "error"` registers the tooltip at `<sonarr-prefix>.error`. Complements the "!" glyph + `base08` badge colour. A future shared Core [6] error surface could consume the same `getError()` / `hasError` contract without plugin-side changes

### Network

- [1] ⬜ Network status — show active wired interface name and link state via nmcli; hidden when disconnected

### System Stats

Stats plugins are **data-only**: each polls a source and exposes readable
properties; users compose them with a sibling `BarText` (or any other
component) to render the value. Plugins never know their parent and contain
no presentation logic.

- [1] ✅ CPU usage — `CpuUsage` samples `/proc/stat` and exposes `usage: int`
- [2] ✅ RAM usage — `RamUsage` reads `/proc/meminfo`; exposes `totalKb`, `availableKb`, `usedKb`, `percent`
- [3] ✅ AMD GPU stats — `GpuUsage` reads `/sys/class/drm/<card>/device/{gpu_busy_percent,mem_info_vram_used,mem_info_vram_total}` (configurable `cardPath`); exposes `busy`, `vramUsedB`, `vramTotalB`, `vramUsedMb`, `vramTotalMb`. Nvidia deferred — needs `nvidia-smi` via `extraBins`, no hardware on this host
- [4] ✅ Disk usage — `DiskUsage` shells out to `df -B1 <mounts>` every 60 s; exposes `results: [{ mount, usedB, totalB }]`
- [5] ✅ Temperature — `CpuTemp` and `GpuTemp` walk `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*` (via `bash`) matching their `sensor` property (defaults `"zenpower"` / `"amdgpu"`) against each `name` file and read `temp1_input`; expose `temp: int` (°C). Users colour-code in their `BarText` binding via `warnColor` / `errorColor`

### Docker

- [1] ⬜ Docker status — running container count badge; click opens a panel listing all containers with name, image, and status
- [2] ⬜ Container actions — start/stop/restart individual containers from the panel
- [3] ⬜ Log tail — select a container in the panel and stream its logs inline (`docker logs -f`)

### Aspire

- [1] ⬜ Aspire status — running service count badge sourced from `aspire ps`; hidden when no Aspire session is active
- [2] ⬜ Aspire panel — click to open a list of all services with their state, endpoint URLs, and health; click a URL to open in browser
- [3] ⬜ Resource drill-down — select a service to tail its structured logs inline

### Notifications

- [1] ✅ Notifications indicator — bar plugin showing a bell icon; hidden when unread count is zero
- [2] ⬜ Unread badge — numeric badge overlaid on the bell showing unread notification count; sourced from `Quickshell.Services.Notifications`
- [3] ⬜ Do Not Disturb indicator — bell icon reflects DND state (e.g. muted icon variant) when DND is active
- [4] ⬜ Click to open panel — clicking the indicator toggles the Notification Center panel (to be implemented in the Notification Center section)

---

## Notification Center

Standalone Quickshell daemon replacing `mako`/`dunst`. Shows incoming toasts
and a persistent history panel (toggle via SUPER or bar button). Groups
notifications by app, supports action buttons, and integrates a Do Not
Disturb toggle.

### Toasts

- [1] ⬜ Incoming toasts — transient popup per notification with app icon, summary, and body; auto-dismisses after timeout
- [2] ⬜ Urgency handling — `critical` notifications ignore DND and persist until dismissed; `low` notifications skip the toast entirely

### History Panel

- [1] ⬜ Persistent history panel — toggle via SUPER or bar button; all notifications since last clear, grouped by app; dismiss individual or all
- [2] ⬜ Action buttons — render notification action buttons; click executes the action via DBus reply
- [3] ⬜ Do Not Disturb toggle — suppress toasts while enabled; history still accumulates; togglable from the bar and the panel

---

## Audio Mixer

Per-app volume mixing UI, replacing `pavucontrol`. Shows all active audio
streams grouped by app, with per-app volume sliders, mute toggles, and live
visualizations indicating which apps are currently producing audio. Toggle via
IPC/keybind.

### Core

- [1] ⬜ Stream list — all active PipeWire audio streams grouped by app, with app icon and name
- [2] ⬜ Per-app volume slider — drag or scroll to adjust individual stream volume
- [3] ⬜ Per-app mute toggle — click to mute/unmute a stream
- [4] ⬜ Output device selector — choose the default sink from a list of available PipeWire sinks

### Visualization

- [1] ⬜ Live activity indicator — VU meter or pulse animation showing which streams are currently producing audio

---

## Patchbay

PipeWire graph editor, replacing `qpwgraph`/`Helvum`. Visualises all PipeWire
nodes (audio, MIDI, video) as boxes with input/output ports, and the links
between them. Keyboard-first — every connect/disconnect that can be done with
a mouse drag must also be doable with vim-style motion + action bindings and
via IPC. Toggle via IPC/keybind.

### Core

- [1] ⬜ Node graph — all PipeWire nodes rendered as boxes with their name, media class (Audio/Sink, Audio/Source, Stream/Output/Audio, Midi/Bridge, Video/Source, …), and port list; sourced from `pw-dump` or the `libpipewire` Quickshell bindings if available
- [2] ⬜ Port rows — each node shows input ports on the left edge and output ports on the right edge, labelled with channel/port name
- [3] ⬜ Links — bezier/orthogonal edges drawn between connected output and input ports; colour-coded by media type (audio / MIDI / video)
- [4] ⬜ Live updates — subscribe to PipeWire registry events so node add/remove/link/unlink is reflected in the graph without polling
- [5] ⬜ Media type filter — toggle audio / MIDI / video visibility independently; hidden types dim their nodes and links
- [6] ⬜ IPC — `target: "patchbay"`; `toggle()`, `open()`, `close()`, `nav(dir)`, `key(k)`, `connect(srcNode, srcPort, dstNode, dstPort)`, `disconnect(...)`, `listNodes()`, `listLinks()`

### Navigation

- [1] ⬜ Modal normal/insert — opens in normal mode; `j`/`k`/`h`/`l` move focus between nodes by spatial adjacency; `/` enters insert mode with a search field filtering nodes by name
- [2] ⬜ Port selection — once a node is focused, `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` cycles through its ports; selected port visually highlighted
- [3] ⬜ Follow link — `gd` on a connected port jumps focus to the peer port on the other side of the link
- [4] ⬜ Zoom and pan — `+`/`-` zoom, `Ctrl+hjkl` pan the viewport; `gg` centres the graph; `z.` centres on the focused node

### Editing

- [1] ⬜ Connect — with an output port selected, press `c` (or Enter) to enter "target mode"; navigate to an input port and confirm to create the link; Escape cancels
- [2] ⬜ Disconnect — `d` on a selected link deletes it; confirmation popup for bulk operations
- [3] ⬜ Visual link select — `v` enters visual mode; select multiple links by walking the graph; `d` disconnects all selected links
- [4] ⬜ Auto-layout — `=` re-runs the layout algorithm (topological left-to-right, sources → sinks) to untangle edges after heavy editing

### Layout

- [1] ⬜ Automatic layout — topological sort from sources to sinks with per-column stacking; collision-free edge routing
- [2] ⬜ Manual node positions — drag (or `m` + hjkl in normal mode) to move a node; positions persisted to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/kh-patchbay/layout.json` keyed by node name so reconnecting a device restores its position
- [3] ⬜ Group nodes — collapse all nodes belonging to the same application (e.g. Firefox streams, Chromium streams) into a single expandable group node to reduce clutter

### Patches

- [1] ⬜ Save patch — `:w <name>` writes the current link set to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/kh-patchbay/patches/<name>.json`; records each link as `(srcNode, srcPort, dstNode, dstPort)` so it can be restored even after a reboot
- [2] ⬜ Load patch — `:e <name>` (or fuzzy-searchable load dialog) re-creates saved links; missing nodes are reported via the plugin error surface
- [3] ⬜ Auto-apply on device reconnect — watch for node additions and re-apply any saved patch whose endpoints match; useful for USB audio interfaces that get different IDs on reconnect

---

## OSD

Transient overlay that appears briefly on system events such as volume
changes. Currently a single hardcoded volume display; the end goal is a
plugin architecture matching the bar — user-composable slots, each slot an
independent QML component with its own PipeWire/system bindings and IPC,
so any combination of indicators can be shown without forking the daemon.

### Core

- [1] ✅ Volume OSD — appears on volume up/down/mute; shows icon and progress bar reflecting the new level
- [2] ✅ Auto-dismiss — fades out after ~2 s; timer resets if the value changes again before dismissal
- [3] ✅ IPC trigger — `qs ipc call osd showVolume <0–100>` / `qs ipc call osd showMuted`
- [4] ⬜ Plugin system — replace hardcoded volume slot with user-composable OSD plugins, following the same pattern as the bar (`OsdPlugin` base type, `nix.osd.structure` config string, `extraPluginDirs`)
- [5] ⬜ Volume plugin — extract current volume display into a first-party `OsdVolume` plugin
- [6] ⬜ Per-plugin dismiss timer — each active plugin manages its own visibility and timer independently so multiple plugins can coexist without interfering

### Audio plugins

Each plugin is **reactive** — subscribes to its own signal source, self-triggers on a state transition, then dismisses. The daemon needs no upfront knowledge of individual plugins.

- **OsdVolume** *(first-party, extracted from current impl)* — volume level on up/down/mute; icon + progress bar via PipeWire
- **OsdMicMute** — microphone mute toggle indicator; useful for push-to-talk or global mute keys; via PipeWire input sink

### Connectivity plugins

- **OsdBluetooth** — device name + connected/disconnected icon on pairing events; via Quickshell Bluetooth bindings
- **OsdVpn** — VPN interface up/down; IPC-driven (no standard DBus signal)

---

## File Viewer

One-shot viewer for arbitrary text or image files. Accepts N file arguments
or stdin; shows all files side-by-side with Tab to cycle focus between panes.

### Core

- [1] ✅ `nix run .#kh-view -- <file> [<file2> ...]` or `<cmd> | nix run .#kh-view`
- [2] ✅ Image detection by extension (png/jpg/jpeg/gif/webp/bmp/svg)
- [3] ✅ N files shown side-by-side in equal-width panes; Tab cycles focus; active divider highlights
- [4] ✅ `q`/`Esc` quits
- [5] ✅ IPC — `target: "view"`; `next()`/`prev()`/`seek(n)`/`quit()`/`setFullscreen(bool)`/`key(k)`; readable props `currentIndex`, `count`, `fullscreen`, `hasPrev`, `hasNext`
- [6] ⬜ Optional pane labels — each pane optionally shows a header bar with a short name and description; `kh-view` accepts label metadata alongside each file via a sidecar format or extended list protocol *(implement together with Dev Tooling → screenshot skill labels)*
- [7] ⬜ Monitor selection — `--monitor <name|index>` flag; defaults to the monitor containing the active window

### Navigation

- [1] ✅ Per-pane cursor and motions — `hjkl`/`w`/`b`/`e`/`W`/`B`/`E`; `0`/`$`/`^` line; `gg`/`G`/`Ctrl+D`/`U` scroll
- [2] ✅ Per-pane visual select — `v`/`V`/`Ctrl+V` char/line/block; word motions extend; `y` copies selection
- [3] ✅ Fullscreen mode — `f` toggles single fullscreen pane; `h`/`l` steps through all loaded files; dot indicators at bottom center

### Content

- [1] ⬜ Syntax highlighting — detect language from file extension; apply token-level colouring using Tree-sitter or `bat` themes
- [2] ⬜ Directory and glob input — `kh-view ./images/` opens all recognised media files; `kh-view ./images/*.png` expands the glob; files sorted by name
- [3] ⬜ Image gallery mode — `g` toggles a grid thumbnail view when all panes are images; `hjkl` navigate; Enter opens selected image fullscreen

---

## Process Manager

Keyboard-driven process viewer, replacing `htop`. Shows running processes
sortable by CPU, RAM, or name; `k` kills the selected process. Toggle via
keybind or IPC, or open by clicking a System Stats bar widget.

### Core

- [1] ⬜ Process list — all running processes with PID, name, CPU %, and RAM usage; sourced from `/proc`
- [2] ⬜ Sort — cycle sort column with `s`; toggle ascending/descending with `S`
- [3] ⬜ Filter — `/` to search by process name
- [4] ⬜ IPC trigger — openable from bar widget clicks on CPU or RAM

### Actions

- [1] ⬜ Kill — `k` sends SIGTERM to the selected process; `K` sends SIGKILL; confirmation popup before executing

### Views

- [1] ⬜ Tree view — `t` toggles parent/child process tree layout

---

## Diff Viewer

Side-by-side two-pane file diff. `kh-diff file1 file2` or pipe from `git diff`
/ `diff`. Keyboard-driven; vim motion navigation. Natural sibling to File Viewer.

### Core

- [1] ⬜ Two-pane diff — left/right panes showing old and new versions with added/removed/changed lines highlighted
- [2] ⬜ Pipe input — `git diff | kh-diff` or `diff -u a b | kh-diff` reads unified diff from stdin and renders it
- [3] ⬜ IPC — same pattern as File Viewer

### Navigation

- [1] ⬜ `]c` / `[c` jump to next/previous change hunk
- [2] ⬜ `Tab` cycles focus between panes; `hjkl` scroll within a pane; `gg`/`G`/`Ctrl+D`/`U` navigate
- [3] ⬜ `y` copies the selected hunk or visual selection

---

## Screenshot

Region/window/fullscreen capture tool, replacing Flameshot. Captures via
`grim`/`slurp`; result goes to clipboard or is saved to a file. Triggered
via keybind or IPC.

### Core

- [1] ⬜ Region capture — `slurp` crosshair selection; result copied to clipboard via `wl-copy`
- [2] ⬜ Fullscreen capture — capture the focused monitor immediately
- [3] ⬜ Window capture — click to select a window; captures its geometry via Hyprland IPC
- [4] ⬜ IPC trigger — `qs ipc call screenshot <region|fullscreen|window>` so any keybind daemon can drive it

### Output

- [1] ⬜ Save to file — write to `$XDG_PICTURES_DIR/Screenshots/` with a timestamp filename in addition to clipboard copy
- [2] ⬜ Annotation layer — draw arrows, boxes, and text over the capture before copying/saving

---

## Dev Tooling

Improvements to the Claude skills and agentic development workflow.

- [1] ⬜ `screenshot` skill passes labels to `kh-view` — once kh-view supports optional pane labels, update the skill to supply a name and short description for each shot (what app/state it shows, what to look for); makes review sessions self-documenting without manual annotation *(implement together with File Viewer → optional pane labels)*
- [2] ⬜ Headless Hyprland for workspace preview screenshots — `kh-bar`'s Workspaces plugin uses
  `Quickshell.Hyprland` types and `ScreencopyView`, which require a live Hyprland session;
  Sway headless can't drive them.

  **Dead ends already tried** (don't bother):
  - `WLR_BACKENDS=headless` — ignored by Aquamarine
  - `AQ_BACKENDS=headless` — not a real env var
  - `hyprland --headless` — flag does not exist
  - Nesting (leaving `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` set) — renders visibly on the real session
  - `HYPRLAND_HEADLESS_ONLY=1` — used by Hyprland's own
    [`hyprtester`](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/tree/main/hyprtester) CI framework,
    but creates no Wayland display socket; Hyprland's IPC socket exists but Quickshell
    can't connect as a Wayland client. Only useful for testing Hyprland internals directly.

  **Fix:** `boot.kernelModules = [ "vkms" ]` in NixOS config. VKMS is a virtual kernel DRM
  device with no physical output; Hyprland's DRM backend accepts it and Aquamarine
  initialises fully, including creating a Wayland display socket for clients to connect.

  **Implementation sketch** (once VKMS is loaded): add `--compositor hyprland` to
  `nix run .#screenshot`; launch with `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `DISPLAY`, and
  `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE` unset; detect the Wayland socket at
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wayland-*` and IPC sig at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hypr/<sig>/`;
  seed fake windows via `exec-once = [workspace N] weston-simple-shm` so
  `ScreencopyView` has something to capture.

---

## Possibly

Ideas with clear value but no committed timeline.

### Applications

- **Scratchpad** — persistent floating notepad toggled by keybind; plain text, autosaved to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/kh-scratch`; vim bindings; `y` copies selection
- **Log viewer** — tail `journalctl` or arbitrary log files with unit/level filter; keyboard-driven alternative to `kitty -e journalctl`

### Plugins

#### Bar

- **Ping + bandwidth monitor** — rolling average latency to a configured host plus live upload/download throughput; colour-coded latency indicator; hidden when idle below threshold
- **Multiple time zones** — show additional configured time zones alongside the main clock; click to expand a list of all configured zones

#### Launcher

- **SSH launcher plugin** — fuzzy-searches `~/.ssh/config` hosts; Enter opens kitty with `ssh <host>`
- **Web search prefixes** — configurable prefix → URL mappings (e.g. `g <q>` → Google, `gh <q>` → GitHub, `mdn <q>` → MDN); defined in Nix; Enter opens in default browser
- **Browser history** — fuzzy search Firefox/Chromium history by title and URL; reads from the browser's SQLite history database; Enter opens in browser; read-only, no write access to profile

---

## Probably Not

Considered and deprioritised. Kept here to avoid re-litigating.

### Applications

- **Font browser** — grid/list of installed fonts with live preview text
- **Wallpaper picker** — browse and apply wallpapers via `swww`; no wallpapers in use

### Plugins

#### Bar

- **Pomodoro** — countdown timer; IPC controllable; notification on completion
- **Weather** — current conditions widget fetching from `wttr.in`; 3-day forecast dropdown
- **Night light** — toggle `wlsunset`/`gammastep` on/off with a colour temperature slider
- **NixOS update notifier** — badge when `nix flake metadata` shows the system is behind upstream
- **Keyboard layout switcher** — current layout; click/scroll to cycle via `hyprctl switchxkblayout`
- **GitHub/GitLab notifications** — unread badge via API; click to list PRs/issues/mentions
- **Crypto/stock ticker** — live price widget
- **Git branch indicator** — active branch for the focused window's CWD; unclear what "focused window's repo" means outside a terminal
- **Clock timestamp copy** — click the clock to copy the current time; too niche and a widget action with no visual feedback is confusing

#### Launcher

- **Calculator plugin** — evaluate expressions in the search field; Enter copies result to clipboard
- **Recent files plugin** — fuzzy search `recently-used.xbel`; Enter opens in default app
- **Password generator** — generate and copy a random password
- **IDE project picker** — fuzzy search project directories and open in editor; terminal workflow already covers this
- **Dictionary** — inline word definition via WordNet; search engine covers the need

#### OSD

- **OsdCapsLock** / **OsdNumLock** — lock key state indicators; technically feasible but not worth the screen noise
- **OsdPowerProfile** — profile changes are infrequent and visible in the bar; OSD adds little
- **OsdColourTemperature** — night light transitions are gradual; a transient overlay is more disruptive than the change itself
- **OsdNowPlaying** — the bar's MediaPlayer already covers this; an OSD duplicate adds noise without value

---

## Future Laptop Support

Features deferred until the system runs on a laptop. No implementation timeline.

### Plugins

#### Bar

- **Battery bar module** — percentage + charging indicator via `/sys/class/power_supply`; dropdown with estimated time remaining and power profile selector
- **WiFi bar module** — connection name and signal strength in the bar; dropdown listing nearby networks with connect support (password prompt for new ones)
- **WiFi tile** — `WifiPanel`; toggle WiFi on/off and show connection status; pairs with the WiFi bar module
- **Power profiles** — cycle `power-profiles-daemon` profiles (power-saver / balanced / performance); show active profile as an icon
- **Bluetooth manager** — list paired devices, connect/disconnect, toggle Bluetooth on/off; replaces reaching for `bluetoothctl` or a tray app

#### OSD

- **OsdBrightness** — brightness level on step changes; icon + progress bar; IPC-driven (`qs ipc call osd showBrightness <0–100>`)
- **OsdBattery** — level indicator on plug/unplug and when crossing thresholds (20 %, 10 %, 5 %); via UPower
